Cybot Personalities

Cybot 1 - Red: Breakdances when it detects the player is close, and then either chases the player, or continues to dance.
Cybot 2 - Pink: Only chases the player when another Cybot is chasing the player. (So a game with only Cybot 2s would never chase the player, because none would have the precondition satisfied). (Does not consider when there are Cybot 4s chasing the player).
Cybot 3 - Dark Blue: Gives up chasing the player after some random time between 5 sec and 20 sec has passed.
Cybot 4 - Baby Blue: Always knows where the player is, and always chases them, no matter where they are. (Does not count toward Cybot 2's needing the player to be chased by a cybot).
Cybot 5 - Cyan: Always wanders, (never actually chases the player). (But a player that is close to two of them will still be captured)
Cybot 6 - Green: Runs really fast once he detects the player
Cybot 7 - Yellow: Never chases the player. Instead, wanders until it finds another Cybot (That is not of type 7) and will follow that one, and match its speed. (This causes flocks of cybots to form)
Cybot 8 - Orange: When chasing the player, it will spawn a new cybot onto the map every 5 seconds. (Up to 10 cybots spawned per Cybot 8 on the map. Can also spawn omore Cybot 8s)
Cybot 9 - Black: Wanders until it detects a player is close, and then chases the player until the player is not longer close
Cybot 10 - White: Punches the player (just an animation) when it gets close enough to the player to be considered captured. Can also physically push the player.


Cybots shoot a red laser out of their eyes when they see a player, every three seconds. When the player is hit, he will get a speed penalty of -50% for 2 seconds. Cybots can detect players when they are close.

The starting scene should be the MainMenu Scene, if you want to configure which cybots are loaded into the game.
